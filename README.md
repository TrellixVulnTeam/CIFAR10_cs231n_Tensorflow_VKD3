## CIFAR Dataset for Tensorflow

It's common to see tutorials using `mnist` dataset provided by Tensorflow.

I'm expecting more.

In this repo, I wrap up code adapt from my cs231n class and `mnist` code in Tensorflow.

So you can write training code as if you're training with Tensorflow `mnist` dataset but in fact using CIFAR dataset

Enjoy!

## Note

- `cifar/cs231n`: most of the code in this directory is copied from the famous computer vision course in Stanford. You can find the course content over [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu)
